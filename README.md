Weâ€™re a bunch of engineers who not only love to program, but also have a passion for teaching. We want to provide an avenue for students to freely explore the different facets of coding without the pressures of grades. We want to foster an environment where students can organically find their interest in creating, building and problem solving. We want to turn programming from something the students have to do into something they want to do. 

Our curriculum is designed to have 10 sessions, with each session lasting 90 - 120 minutes. Ideally this program will take place on the weekend for 10 consecutive weeks.
